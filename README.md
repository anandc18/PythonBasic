List	Tuple	Set	Dictionary
List is a non-homogeneous data structure which stores the elements in single row and multiple rows and columns	Tuple is also a non-homogeneous data structure which stores single row and multiple rows and columns	Set data structure is also non-homogeneous data structure but stores in single row	Dictionary is also a non-homogeneous data structure which stores key value pairs
List can be represented by [ ]	
Tuple can be represented by  

( )

Set can be represented by { }	Dictionary  can be represented by { }
List allows duplicate elements	Tuple allows duplicate elements	Set will not allow duplicate elements	Set will not allow duplicate elements but keys are not duplicated
List can use nested among all	Tuple can use nested among all	Set can use nested among all	Dictionary can use nested among all
Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]	Example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)	Example: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}	Example: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
List can be created using list() function	Tuple can be created using tuple() function.	Set can be created using set() function	Dictionary can be created using dict() function.
List is mutable i.e we can make any changes in list.	Tuple  is immutable i.e we can not make any changes in tuple	Set is mutable i.e we can make any changes in set. But elements are not duplicated.	Dictionary is mutable. But Keys are not duplicated.
List is ordered	Tuple is ordered	Set is unordered	Dictionary is ordered
Creating an empty list

l=[]

Creating an empty Tuple

t=()

Creating a set

a=set()

b=set(a)

Creating an empty dictionary

d={}
