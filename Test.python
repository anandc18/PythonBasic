#TUPLES IN python

#A tuple is a collection of different data types which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable). Tuples are written with round brackets, (). Once a tuple is created, we cannot change its values. We cannot use add, insert, remove methods in a tuple because it is not modifiable (mutable). Unlike list, tuple has few methods. Methods related to tuples:

#- tuple(): to create an empty tuple
#- count(): to count the number of a specified item in a tuple
#- index(): to find the index of a specified item in a tuple
#- + operator: to join two or more tuples and to create a new tuple

all_items  = ('test','1','Hello')
print(all_items[-2])

#Sets in python
#Set is a collection of unordered and unindexed distinct elements. In python set is used to store unique items, and it is possible to find the _union_, _intersection_, _difference_, _symmetric difference_, _subset_, _super set_ and _disjoint set_ among sets.
st = set("Hello world")
print(st)
st.add("welcome")
print(st)

#Dictionaeris in python
dct = {'key1':'value1', 'key2':'value2', 'key3':'value3', 'key4':'value4'}
print(dct['key1'])
print(dct.items())
